This is a self-implementation of some elementary operators in CUDA/CPP. There are some notes in each category. Most of those notes are the thoughts of my learning journey, they are just for referenc and please be aware **there might be some mistakes**. BTW, if there are some mistakes please let me know. Since I'm taking notes on obsidian and the original .md file contains a lot of irrelevant content I will upload my notes in pdf format. Hope that won't bother you.

CUDA is hard to learn, hopefully I can stick around and document the journey of learning the it.
